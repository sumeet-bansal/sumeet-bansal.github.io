# About Me

Hi, I'm Sumeet!

I'm a Bay Area native, I studied computer science and a bit of math at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), and some of my current interests include road cycling, 3+2 chess, arthouse film, and jazz fusion.

I recently spent three and a half years as a software engineer at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/), developing the time series product to support mission-critical workflows at the world's most important institutions. I previously interned at [Zscaler](https://www.zscaler.com/) and [IBM Watson Health](https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/).

At UCSD I co-founded [ACM UCSD](https://acmucsd.com/), an ACM chapter that became UCSD's largest engineering student org, with 1000+ members, weeks after launch; was a DJ and computer engineer at [KSDT](https://ksdt.ucsd.edu/), UCSD's college radio station; and was a member of [Triton Software Engineering](https://tse.ucsd.edu/), a campus organization that partners with non-profits to design and develop thoughtful mobile and web apps for social good.
