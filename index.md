# About Me

Hi, I'm Sumeet!

I'm a Bay Area native studying Mathematics and Computer Science at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/), and some of my favorite things include design, pad thai, and hip-hop.

I'm the webmaster for [SEDS UCSD](https://sedsucsd.org/), an engineering organization working on several space-related projects, and the president of [Triton Software Engineering](http://tritonse.github.io/), a multidisciplinary student-run organization that partners with non-profits to design and develop thoughtful mobile and web apps for social good. On the side, I'm also part of the computer engineering team at [KSDT](https://ksdt.ucsd.edu/), UCSD's college radio station.

I've previously interned at [Zscaler](https://www.zscaler.com/), a global cloud-based info-sec company, and [Actiance](https://www.actiance.com/), a communications compliance multinational. I spent my most recent summer near Chicago, working with the [IBM Watson Health](https://www.ibm.com/watson/health/) team.

And, I'm a pretty big hip-hop head. If you're at all interested, you can check out what I've been listening to recently on [my last.fm profile](https://www.last.fm/user/sbansal21/).
